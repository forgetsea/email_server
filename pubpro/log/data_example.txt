Knockdown of PRMT1 enhanced the radiotherapy sensitivity of GSCs-like cells, which wasu00a0evidenced by reduced survival fraction in GSC-U87 and GSC-SHG44 underwent sh-PRMT1 transfection.

{ "abstract ":  "Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive dementia, is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. Clinical trial results of amyloid-  u03b2 (A  u03b2) and tau regulators based on the pretext of straightforward amyloid and tau immunotherapy were disappointing. There are currently no effective strategies for slowing the progression of AD. Herein, we spotlight the dysregulation of lipid metabolism, particularly the elevation of ceramides (Cers), as a critical yet underexplored facet of AD pathogenesis. Our study delineates the role of Cers in promoting microglial pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death distinct from apoptosis and necroptosis, characterized by cellular swelling, and membrane rupture mediated by the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway.
